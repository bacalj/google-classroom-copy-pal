# Google Classroom Copy Pal

It turns out to be really annoying trying to copy the names of assignments from a Google Classroom classwork page.  Either you grab stuff you don't want, or you try to go title by title and can't becuase your clicks keep triggering dropdowns or drags.  

This Chrome extension will let you add checkboxes to each item on your Classwork tab.  Select the titles you want to copy, and they are copied in plain text to your clipboard. 

## How to use it

1. Activate the extension.

3. Click the *Show checkboxes* to choose the item titles you want to copy.

4. Choose which items you want to copy by checking them off. 

5. Click the *Copy checked items to the clipboard*

6. Paste your list somewhere!
